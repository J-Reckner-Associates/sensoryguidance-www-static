In addition to helping you understanding the scientific process<br \/>\nand data analysis, the research team ultimately seeks to help you make strong<br \/>\nrecommendations that answer business questions.<\/li>\n<li>Diversify the sensory space by including products that represent a wide<br \/>\nvariety of sensory characteristics. This will help you to achieve a holistic<br \/>\nunderstanding of the category and find product gaps and new product<br \/>\nopportunities in the market place.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that Drivers of Liking are calculated within the space defined by<br \/>\nthe products included in the test. Therefore, it is a good practice to include<br \/>\nat least one competitive product that you think may perform better than your<br \/>\nproduct if you are looking for opportunities to improve your product.<\/li>\n<li>Use the same serving protocol for Consumers and Trained Panelists.<br \/>\nPanelists may additionally test products in non-consumer ways (e.g., eating<br \/>\nsyrup without a waffle).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>The Do Not&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Push the Trained Panel to profile on sensory characteristics that your team<br \/>\nbelieves are important. The Panel Leader can address your concerns during<br \/>\ntraining, but it is best to not bias the Panel.<\/li>\n<li>Schedule consumer testing and sensory profiling more than a couple of<br \/>\ndays apart. The age of the samples should be the same for Consumers and<br \/>\nTrained Panelists.<\/li>\n<li>Include too many or too few products. The ideal number of products to<br \/>\ninclude in a category appraisal is eight to fifteen.<\/li>\n<li>Include samples that are extremely divergent or that profile on the opposite<br \/>\nspectrum from samples selected for category appraisal. The data extreme<br \/>\ncharacteristics of the sample profile do not allow for good differentiation of<br \/>\nother samples and can skew the data to one side.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some best practices for your next Category Appraisal. <a href=\"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/2016\/05\/31\/blog-post-title-3\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":42,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=9"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/42"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=9"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sensoryguidance.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=9"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
