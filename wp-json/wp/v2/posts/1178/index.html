Often, our clients utilize our research findings to be confident that they can make a particular claim in their marketing and packaging materials.   This was the thinking in this case study with our client who manufactures throat lozenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our client, a confectionery manufacturer, wanted to develop a milder version of their current product for consumers seeking low intensity lozenges.  In addition, they wanted&nbsp;supportive data to make the \u201cmilder taste\u201d claim on the product package. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used Descriptive Analysis to evaluate 2 products &#8212; the original mint lozenge and the re-formulated mint lozenge.  Our 12 panelists from a trained descriptive panel evaluated each of the lozenges in our Harrison, NY sensory booths.  Training was held on key attribute intensities:  Overall Total Impact, Overall Flavor, and Cooling.  An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s means separation was used with 95% confidence level to understand attribute differences among samples. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Results<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our findings indicated that our client could confidently claim that their new mint lozenge was milder in taste than the current product.
