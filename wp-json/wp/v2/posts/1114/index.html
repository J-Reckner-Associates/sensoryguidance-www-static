What\u2019s changed in sensory research and what might be in store for the next 20 years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\nare our observations about how sensory research has evolved, at least from the\nISR perspective!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Category\nExpansion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\nused to be that sensory research was the purview of food and beverage\nmanufacturers alone. Over time, other product categories have sought insights\nfrom sensory research. For example, our personal care clients were one of the\nfirst in the industry to leverage sensory research for everything from\nformulation changes to category appraisals.&nbsp;\nNow, sensory research is widely used in skin, hair and oral care\u2026so much\nso that we have 12 dedicated, highly-utilized sink booths in our facility.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensory\nresearch is also increasingly used in other \u201cnon-traditional sensory\u201d\ncategories.&nbsp; Among the most frequent\nusers are household and automotive care (think fragrance and texture\nmeasurements) and tech-based personal care products (think light therapy and\nelectric exfoliators).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Research\nAgility<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with so much in our 5G world, speed has become king, and sensory research is no exception.&nbsp; Where clients used to have months available for a sensory project, now they need guidance in weeks.&nbsp; Fortunately, having trained sensory panels and experienced sensory research staff enables research agility.&nbsp; And, we\u2019ve incorporated new methodologies that enable clients to gain insights quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Global\nReach<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\ntoo, sensory research reflects the intercontinental world we live in.&nbsp; Whether it\u2019s U.S. clients looking for sensory\nanalysis in new markets or international clients seeking sensory research in\nAmerica, global reach and the ability to craft a comprehensive global research\nplan is essential.&nbsp; While most clients\nseek foundational sensory work, we do see global studies over time, such as\nmulti-year category appraisals \u2013 which are particularly important in evolving\nmarkets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Tech First<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019d\nbe remiss in not including a mention about the growing importance of technology\nin sensory research, despite the fact that we were one of the first agencies to\nincorporate computers into the sensory lab (while others were still recording\ndata on pen and paper!).&nbsp; Today\u2019s tech\nincludes touchpad computers, cameras and microphones in every testing booth, web-enabled video cameras, wireless tablets, video\nconferencing, digital audio and video recording, and wireless internet access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Sensory\nPanels Coming Full Circle<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\nthe beginning, there were sensory panels at sensory research agencies. Then,\nthere were sensory panels at client sites.&nbsp;\nNow, despite there being client site panels, those panels are often\noutsourced to sensory agencies for recruiting, training and managing.&nbsp; Further as return on investment (ROI) becomes\nthe new old word, clients are finding that their on-site panels are often\ninefficient and labor intensive, with constant struggles to find work to keep\ntheir panels engaged. And so, in many ways, sensory panels have come full\ncircle with research moving back into the sensory company for trained,\nsemi-trained and even consumer panels.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From\nspeed and tech demands to ROI and worldly views, two decades of sensory\nresearch have reaffirmed what we already know:&nbsp;\nsensory research reflects the products, the clients, the world which it\nserves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\nlook forward to serving you for another 20 years and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#006db6\" class=\"has-text-color\"><em>Thank you for partnering with us in this exciting sensory journey. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re celebrating 20 years of sensory research and \u2013 would you believe it? \u2013 that makes us an old-timer in this industry!
