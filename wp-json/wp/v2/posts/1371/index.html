Then, a batch of pilot plant trial samples was produced.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, texture differences are observed in pilot plant samples when compared to benchtop samples, therefore our objective is to compare the sensory profile of the \u2018benchtop\u2019 samples with the \u2018pilot plant trial\u2019 samples and understand if there are differences and if any optimizations are needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Methodology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We conducted Descriptive Analysis with our panel of sensory experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data was collected using t-test. The t-test is a method that determines whether two populations are statistically different from each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our lexicon training encompassed several attributes, such as aroma, texture in mouth, taste, flavor and aftertaste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What We Learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no differences detected between the Control \u2013 Benchtop and Test \u2013 Pilot samples.
