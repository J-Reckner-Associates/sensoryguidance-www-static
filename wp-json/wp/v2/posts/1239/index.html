If you need a high level of control,\nsuch as in benchmarking and drivers of liking, then virtual sensory research\ncan be challenging.&nbsp; However, for\nresearch where there\u2019s a bit of flexibility \u2013 think process changes, ingredient\nchanges, quality improvements, even discrimination tests &#8211; these can be\nconducted successfully via remote sensory research. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Give yourself some\nlead time<\/strong>.&nbsp; Connecting virtually may\nbe near instantaneous, but conducting research virtually requires some\ntime.&nbsp; Products needs to be shipped to\nour sensory facility, then separated and repacked individually.&nbsp; Application instructions and other items are\nalso packaged and then couriers are scheduled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Think about the\ntools.<\/strong>&nbsp; In a lab setting, we can\ncontrol various elements (i.e., oven temperature, skin cleansing, the level of\nmixing). In remote research, we need to provide the tools which afford us an\nenhanced level of control \u2013 hello, food thermometers, soap, and blenders. It\u2019s\nimportant to think through the application or preparation process and provide\nthe additions that ensure consistency in the test process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step-up the training.\n<\/strong>We provide significantly more communication and detail than would normally\nbe necessary.&nbsp; We go beyond paper or\nverbal instructions to leverage live video where we can demonstrate proper\napplication or preparation in real time so panelists can ask us to repeat or\nclarify the protocol. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make it personal.<\/strong>&nbsp; We conduct individual or small-group training\nrather than training in a large group setting. This encourages dialog throughout\nthe process and ensures a more detailed approach to panel training. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, those are our key ingredients.
