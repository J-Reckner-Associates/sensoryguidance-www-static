A lexicon is the language that is typically used to describe the product\u2019s attributes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>The Panel was then trained on the selected attributes.  Upon completion of the training, the panel evaluated the Control and Test samples in 2 replications.  Individual panel scores were collected online and a t-test analysis was performed at 95% confidence level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What We Learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Masking agent did have an impact on the overall Flavor and on the Skunky notes of the Test samples.  The Test Sample with the masking agent was found to have less Overall Flavor Intensity, with less Skunky aroma and flavor; and slightly higher Astringency and bitter aftertaste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"239\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Capture-1-1024x239.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1045\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Capture-1-1024x239.png 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Capture-1-300x70.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Capture-1-768x179.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Capture-1.png 1256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>View the complete case study <a href=\"http:\/\/isr-www.azurewebsites.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/ISR-Case-Study-CBD-Oil-Descriptive-Analysis.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our client wanted to determine whether any sensory differences exist between the Control and Test samples of their Medicinal oil.
