Particularly now, when your current supplier may be struggling to keep up with demand, supplier qualification leveraging sensory research may be critical.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a case study in which our client was qualifying a new supplier of mustard oil, a key ingredient in their product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our client was looking to qualify an alternate supplier of mustard oil.  We needed to determine if a sensory difference exists between the current product and a prototype made with the alternate supplier\u2019s mustard oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using two samples &#8211; the Current Product and the Prototype &#8211; we conducted a Discrimination Test (2-AFC with Reference).  The products were placed with 36 panelists at our facility in Harrison, NY.&nbsp; Sessions were held in the sensory booths, and data was analyzed at 90% confidence level for a two-sided 2-AFC test. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> Results<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned that there were no significant differences between the Control and the Alternate Supplier\u2019s prototype and it was recommended to move forward with the new supplier.  Here&#8217;s an example of the data we presented:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"944\" height=\"495\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/discrimination-test-results.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1148\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/discrimination-test-results.png 944w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/discrimination-test-results-300x157.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/discrimination-test-results-768x403.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our client was pleased that they could move forward with confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingredient qualifications are one of our key service areas &#8211; whether it is for a new supplier, a cost reduction or &#8211; as is very common these days &#8211; an enhanced health or nutritional benefit.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our panel is working remotely, so we can conduct your research at any time.
