Fabric swatches can be placed against the face, as well as touched by hand, to make these assessments.<\/p>\n<p>In the finished good form (i.e., when launching a new product or changing an existing one), descriptive testing (often called \u201cfingerprinting\u201d) is used with a group of trained descriptive panelists for a detailed analysis of wearability, identifying key apparel strengths and limitations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But, why use it?<\/strong>\u00a0 Sensory testing is significantly more affordable and faster than consumer testing, making it appropriate for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New product introductions<\/li>\n<li>Smaller product lines<\/li>\n<li>Product adjustments<\/li>\n<li>Fabric changes<\/li>\n<li>New supplier assessments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pricing on our <a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/ISR-Flash-Discrimination-Testing.pdf\">Flash Discrimination Testing<\/a> starts at $3000.<\/p>\n<p>For a case study on the usage of sensory research in the apparel industry, just contact us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was recently asked this question at Pangborn.
