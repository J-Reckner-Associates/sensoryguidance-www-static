<p>Are you a sensory research team in need of an &#8220;overflow&#8221; testing panel?  We can help!  We offer both consumer and sensory research panels which are available for your use – whether that is for a single project or for an on-going need.  </p>



<p>Many times, our clients have their own employee panels, but having an external resource can be helpful in meeting deadlines &#8211; especially when so many people are working virtually or when teams become overloaded and need to offload their overflow work.</p>



<p>We will execute to your testing protocol and provide the data in the format you require.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a typical &#8220;overflow&#8221; project. This one is for our client who has their own employee panel, but needed assistance when their team was working from home:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’ve been successfully conducting virtual sensory research
for several months now, and many clients are asking what’s our secret
sauce?&nbsp; And, can we make it work for
them?&nbsp; An individual consult is best for
determining applicability, but here are the key ingredients to consider:</p>



<p><strong>Choose the right fit</strong>.&nbsp; Some types of sensory research simply work
better than others in a virtual setting. If you need a high level of control,
such as in benchmarking and drivers of liking, then virtual sensory research
can be challenging.&nbsp; However, for
research where there’s a bit of flexibility – think process changes, ingredient
changes, quality improvements, even discrimination tests &#8211; these can be
conducted successfully via remote sensory research. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Give yourself some
lead time</strong>.&nbsp; Connecting virtually may
be near instantaneous, but conducting research virtually requires some
time.&nbsp; Products needs to be shipped to
our sensory facility, then separated and repacked individually.&nbsp; Application instructions and other items are
also packaged and then couriers are scheduled.</p>



<p><strong>Think about the
tools.</strong>&nbsp; In a lab setting, we can
control various elements (i.e., oven temperature, skin cleansing, the level of
mixing). In remote research, we need to provide the tools which afford us an
enhanced level of control – hello, food thermometers, soap, and blenders. It’s
important to think through the application or preparation process and provide
the additions that ensure consistency in the test process.</p>



<p><strong>Step-up the training.
</strong>We provide significantly more communication and detail than would normally
be necessary.&nbsp; We go beyond paper or
verbal instructions to leverage live video where we can demonstrate proper
application or preparation in real time so panelists can ask us to repeat or
clarify the protocol. </p>



<p><strong>Make it personal.</strong>&nbsp; We conduct individual or small-group training
rather than training in a large group setting. This encourages dialog throughout
the process and ensures a more detailed approach to panel training. </p>



<p>So, those are our key ingredients. Please reach out and
let’s see if we can make our secret sauce work for you!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nearly two months into social distancing, and you may be wondering if virtual sensory research can work for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve conducted virtual research in several food and personal care product categories.  Our key takeaways are that virtual sensory research brings some interesting benefits on par with in-person sensory research.</p>



<p>Here they are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="545" height="436" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1225" data-link="http://isr-www.azurewebsites.net/?attachment_id=1225" class="wp-image-1225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-1.jpg 545w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-1-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="528" height="422" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-9.jpg" alt="" data-id="1226" data-link="http://isr-www.azurewebsites.net/?attachment_id=1226" class="wp-image-1226" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-9.jpg 528w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zoom-9-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Remote-training.jpg" alt="" data-id="1227" data-link="http://isr-www.azurewebsites.net/?attachment_id=1227" class="wp-image-1227" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Remote-training.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Remote-training-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></li></ul>



<p><strong>Community</strong>. With online sessions conducted &#8220;Brady-bunch style&#8221;,&nbsp; panelists can see and hear each other easily and&nbsp;in real-time. This sense of community prompts in-depth discussions and explorations, enhancing the sensory testing.</p>



<p><strong>Collaborative</strong>. The round-table feel of online sessions also creates&nbsp;a collaborative environment with each panelist having time to share, so lexicon creation is more powerful.</p>



<p><strong>Detailed</strong>. Sensory Panel Leaders plan out and then dive into the product details, enumerating&nbsp;all aspects of the test on screen.</p>



<p><strong>Individualized</strong>. Particularly with semi-trained consumer panels, sensory testing is conducted in small groups, often 1 &#8211; 2 consumers per session, ensuring an individualized, personalized approach to the testing and allowing Sensory Panel Leaders to coach through the testing process.</p>
