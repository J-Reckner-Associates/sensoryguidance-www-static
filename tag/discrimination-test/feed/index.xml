<p>One of the most common uses of sensory research is qualifying a new supplier. Particularly now, when your current supplier may be struggling to keep up with demand, supplier qualification leveraging sensory research may be critical.  </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a case study in which our client was qualifying a new supplier of mustard oil, a key ingredient in their product.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Our client was looking to qualify an alternate supplier of mustard oil.  We needed to determine if a sensory difference exists between the current product and a prototype made with the alternate supplier’s mustard oil.</p>



<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>



<p>Using two samples &#8211; the Current Product and the Prototype &#8211; we conducted a Discrimination Test (2-AFC with Reference).  The products were placed with 36 panelists at our facility in Harrison, NY.&nbsp; Sessions were held in the sensory booths, and data was analyzed at 90% confidence level for a two-sided 2-AFC test. </p>



<p><strong> Results</strong></p>



<p>We learned that there were no significant differences between the Control and the Alternate Supplier’s prototype and it was recommended to move forward with the new supplier.  Here&#8217;s an example of the data we presented:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="944" height="495" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discrimination-test-results.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1148" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discrimination-test-results.png 944w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discrimination-test-results-300x157.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discrimination-test-results-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></figure>



<p>Our client was pleased that they could move forward with confidence.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Ingredient qualifications are one of our key service areas &#8211; whether it is for a new supplier, a cost reduction or &#8211; as is very common these days &#8211; an enhanced health or nutritional benefit.  </p>



<p>And our panel is working remotely, so we can conduct your research at any time.  Please reach out for more information on how we can help.</p>
