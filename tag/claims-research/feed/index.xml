<p>Did you know that one key area for sensory research is around claims?  Often, our clients utilize our research findings to be confident that they can make a particular claim in their marketing and packaging materials.   This was the thinking in this case study with our client who manufactures throat lozenges.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Our client, a confectionery manufacturer, wanted to develop a milder version of their current product for consumers seeking low intensity lozenges.  In addition, they wanted&nbsp;supportive data to make the “milder taste” claim on the product package. </p>



<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>



<p>We used Descriptive Analysis to evaluate 2 products &#8212; the original mint lozenge and the re-formulated mint lozenge.  Our 12 panelists from a trained descriptive panel evaluated each of the lozenges in our Harrison, NY sensory booths.  Training was held on key attribute intensities:  Overall Total Impact, Overall Flavor, and Cooling.  An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s means separation was used with 95% confidence level to understand attribute differences among samples. </p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>Our findings indicated that our client could confidently claim that their new mint lozenge was milder in taste than the current product.  Here&#8217;s an example of the data we provided:</p>
