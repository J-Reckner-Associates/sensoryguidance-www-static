<p>The future looks bright for Tate &amp; Lyle’s low-calorie sugar, Allulose.  &#8220;Ever since the FDA decided to exclude Tate &amp; Lyle&#8217;s super low-calorie sugar, Allulose, from the total and added sugar declarations on the Nutrition Facts panel, manufacturers across categories have been clamoring to learn how the ingredient might help them meet growing consumer demand for lower-calorie and lower-sugar products.&#8221; (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="FoodNavigator-usa.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/06/18/Tate-Lyle-s-low-calorie-sugar-allulose-easily-snaps-into-formulas-as-traditional-sugar-replacement?fbclid=IwAR3I_ZCz5_iiOssSZl2YzFDHY5KUJT3SJUrcP2D3XPGKqbpaxJMGDgH_-Tc#" target="_blank">FoodNavigator-usa.com</a>) </p>



<p>At ISR, this is a common request from our clients. There&#8217;s a need to make an ingredient change &#8211; sometimes driven from a cost perspective, other times because the ingredient offers new marketing opportunities or responds to consumer demands &#8212; in any case, our clients are concerned about altering consumer perception of their product.</p>



<span id="more-1005"></span>



<p>In these situations, we often use our temporal dominance of sensation technique and our standing sensory panel to help guide manufacturers as they pursue ingredient (or manufacturing) changes to the product.</p>



<p>In the case of Tate &amp; Lyle&#8217;s new offering, Avishan Amanat, Director of ISR, states &#8220;Our TDS technique along with our Descriptive Analysis panel can actually help our clients better understand the influence of Allulose on sweetness level, as well as understand the impact on taste, flavor and aftertaste when used in combination with other sweeteners.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>You can see below how TDS was used in a recent mouthwash analysis.  <br>Our client wanted to compare multiple sensations over time.  We were able to identify which sensations appeared, when they appeared, and how long they lasted.  </p>

<p>TDS can be used for virtually any product category!</p>
