<p>Our client was interested in conducting a Pilot test for at-home application and 24-hour wear assessment of pain relieving patches before fully committing to at-home testing.  Four of the six patches used in a Previous (on site) study were used in this Pilot test, so that results of the Pilot test could be compared to the Previous study.</p>



<p>Our objective was to compare the performance of patches applied and evaluated in the Pilot test (remote) for failure, adhesion, maceration, and<br> residue against the performance of the patches in the Previous<br> (on site) study.</p>



<h4>What We Did</h4>

<h4>What We Learned</h4>



<p>All measurements were comparable between the remote sensory research and the in-person sensory research findings:</p>



<ul><li>time to failure</li><li> average wear time</li><li> maceration</li><li>adhesion side</li><li> adhesion tab</li><li> residue</li></ul>



<h4>Conclusions &amp; Recommendations</h4>



<p>We proceeded with the remote sensory research work and identified a critical success factor &#8211; training of panelists through small group sessions to ensure adherence to process and protocol.</p>
