<p>Need to quickly understand the whole product set in your category?  We use Flash Profiling to answer this question.</p>



<p>Flash Profiling is a fast analysis tool for understanding the relative positioning of products and to get a perceptual map of the product spaces.</p>



<p>We use our trained sensory panel to evaluate the product.  All the products are presented together and panelists create their own attributes.</p>



<span id="more-1037"></span>



<p>At the end of the project, you will know the positions of products according to their major sensory differences and you will have a visual map of the product spaces.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what a Flash Profile Map looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="521" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-1024x521.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1038" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-1024x521.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-300x153.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-768x391.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture.png 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Flash Profile of Medicinal Oil</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Benefits of Flash Profiling</h4>



<ul><li>Language development for descriptive analysis</li><li> Screening tool for product selection</li><li> A sensory base for a preference mapping study</li><li> Enhances the value of in-house and round-table tasting</li></ul>



<h4> Uses of Flash Profiling </h4>



<ul><li>Short shelf-life products</li><li>Projects with one-shot evaluation</li><li>Children&#8217;s panels</li></ul>



<p>Flash Profiling can be used for ALL product categories.</p>

<p>How do color and fragrance attributes influence the perception of an efficacious laundry detergent? We recently explored this by combining consumer qualitative and quantitative research methodologies with flash profiling conducted by a trained descriptive panel. The results are illustrated in our <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ISR-Poster-Pangborn-2019-The-Tide-is-Turning-in-Laundry-Care.pdf">Pangborn 2019 poster. </a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>



<p>Consumers perceive a clear, moderately fragranced high tech laundry detergent to be more efficacious in cleaning laundry.</p>



<p>Fragrance, color, and trust in technology effect consumers&#8217; purchasing decision of a laundry detergent.  Consumers believe that clear laundry detergent with clearly labeled technology on packaging is more effective in cleaning laundry than saturated color detergent. The addition of fragrance to a clear detergent increases efficacy perception but a too low or too high fragranced detergent is perceived to be less efficacious.</p>



<p>Future research is needed to further explore the interaction of other sensory cues that affect the perception of efficacy.</p>

<p>In this case study, our client needed to qualify additional manufacturing lines in order to increase capacity on the production of chewable vitamins.  Providing additional capacity was essential to delivering on order commitments.<br></p>



<p>Most importantly, given the volumes of the business, we had to ensure that this change would not impact the sensory characteristics of the chewable vitamins and risk alienating our clientâ€™s current users.<br></p>



<span id="more-1017"></span>



<p>Leveraging descriptive analysis, we were able to incorporate the inherent variability in the current manufacturing process, so that we did not incorrectly fail a facility due to a difference from a single lot.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with our standing descriptive and discrimination panels (if not, click <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ISR-Sensory-Panel-Solutions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a>), but did you know that we also offer semi-trained consumer panels and in-context panels?  Lately, these panels are very much in demand as manufacturers seek deeper insights into product usage and experiences. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the 101 on these panels:</p>



<span id="more-995"></span>



<h2>In-context Sensory Panels</h2>



<ul><li>These are sensory acute and articulate panelists</li><li>The ISR panel encompasses 20 panel members with a minimum of seven years&#8217; experience</li><li>Trained to objectively evaluate attribute intensities without judging the product on liking (as opposed to consumer tests)</li><li>Able to complete sensory evaluations in context</li><li>Useful for receiving technical feedback as well as experiential feedback</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-997" width="408" height="302" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-6.png 544w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-6-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></figure>



<h2>Semi-trained Consumer Panels</h2>



<ul><li> These are high users of the category </li><li> Trained with protocol and lexicon instruction, utilizing terminology that is precise </li><li> Able to complete sensory evaluations in the lab or in context </li><li> Useful for obtaining emotional and experiential feedback and product guidance. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-998" width="406" height="346" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-7.png 812w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-7-300x255.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-7-768x654.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></figure>


<p>And for those companies who prefer to leverage their own sensory panels, we offer client-site panel recruiting, training, management and auditing services.&nbsp; You can learn more <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ISR-Sensory-Panel-Solutions.pdf">here</a> or just contact us!</p>

<p>The future looks bright for Tate &amp; Lyleâ€™s low-calorie sugar, Allulose.  &#8220;Ever since the FDA decided to exclude Tate &amp; Lyle&#8217;s super low-calorie sugar, Allulose, from the total and added sugar declarations on the Nutrition Facts panel, manufacturers across categories have been clamoring to learn how the ingredient might help them meet growing consumer demand for lower-calorie and lower-sugar products.&#8221; (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="FoodNavigator-usa.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/06/18/Tate-Lyle-s-low-calorie-sugar-allulose-easily-snaps-into-formulas-as-traditional-sugar-replacement?fbclid=IwAR3I_ZCz5_iiOssSZl2YzFDHY5KUJT3SJUrcP2D3XPGKqbpaxJMGDgH_-Tc#" target="_blank">FoodNavigator-usa.com</a>) </p>



<p>At ISR, this is a common request from our clients. There&#8217;s a need to make an ingredient change &#8211; sometimes driven from a cost perspective, other times because the ingredient offers new marketing opportunities or responds to consumer demands &#8212; in any case, our clients are concerned about altering consumer perception of their product.</p>



<span id="more-1005"></span>



<p>In these situations, we often use our temporal dominance of sensation technique and our standing sensory panel to help guide manufacturers as they pursue ingredient (or manufacturing) changes to the product.</p>



<p>In the case of Tate &amp; Lyle&#8217;s new offering, Avishan Amanat, Director of ISR, states &#8220;Our TDS technique along with our Descriptive Analysis panel can actually help our clients better understand the influence of Allulose on sweetness level, as well as understand the impact on taste, flavor and aftertaste when used in combination with other sweeteners.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>You can see below how TDS was used in a recent mouthwash analysis.  <br>Our client wanted to compare multiple sensations over time.  We were able to identify which sensations appeared, when they appeared, and how long they lasted.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Capture-1-1024x355.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1008" width="787" height="266"/></figure>



<p>TDS can be used for virtually any product category!</p>
