<h2>Background</h2>



<p>Our client has moved their vitamin production. Based on the team tasting, the new flavors are considered an improvement from the original flavors. As such, the team would like to add a claim on the product to indicate that the taste has improved.</p>



<h2>Objective</h2>



<p>The study objective is to substantiate the following claim: “Improved Taste” or “New Improved Taste”, using prototypes with new flavors for all vitamins.</p>



<h2>What We Did</h2>



<p>We conducted Descriptive Analysis with our panel of sensory experts with data collecting using a t-test.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<ul><li>Samples were presented using sequential monadic design and blocked by flavor.</li><li>Panelists focused on flavor attributes, including acidity, tartness, and flavor character.</li></ul>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">

<h2>What We Learned</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s the visual representation of how the Peach vitamins compare to each other:</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Our client would like to qualify gelatin from new suppliers but needs to be sure they can do so without changing the sensory profile of their bars.  Additionally, the current gelatin source imparts a perceptible flavor in the finished product, which makes identifying a replacement source difficult.</p>



<p>The team is currently exploring several sources and blends in hopes of achieving a sensory profile as close to current as possible.  The qualification will be made for a 50% replacement (Variant 1) and 100% replacement (Variant 2).</p>



<h2>Methodology</h2>



<p>This study was conducted with our trained sensory panel.  Samples were ranked in intensity for each attribute and scores were given on a numerical scale.</p>



<p>Mahalanobis Analysis was used to calculate the overall differences between the samples for the ranking test followed by an Analysis of Variance with LSD’s mean separation among attributes at 95% confidence level.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sensory-analysis-schedule.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1396" width="491" height="141" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sensory-analysis-schedule.png 865w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sensory-analysis-schedule-300x86.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sensory-analysis-schedule-768x220.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></figure></div>



<h2>What We Learned</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<p>The Control Samples were similar in sensory profile with some differences noted in Nutty flavor, Metallic taste, Denseness, and Dry mouth. </p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="923" height="694" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/control-sample-sensory-profile.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1397" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/control-sample-sensory-profile.png 923w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/control-sample-sensory-profile-300x226.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/control-sample-sensory-profile-768x577.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="881" height="715" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/variant-sensory-profiles.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1399" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/variant-sensory-profiles.png 881w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/variant-sensory-profiles-300x243.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/variant-sensory-profiles-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<p>The Variants were close to the Control ranges in flavor and texture attributes with  differences found in malt flavor, nutty flavor, metallic taste, denseness, dry mouth and sweet aftertaste.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Both 50% and 100% replacements had minimal impact on the overall sensory profile and fell within the tested Control sensory variability. </p>



<p>The gelatin replacements did not change any key flavor notes or impart new flavor or off-notes. The noted differences are likely not noticeable to the consumer.</p>

</div>
</div>



<h2>What We Did</h2>



<p>We assessed Flavor, Aroma, Aftertaste, and Texture attributes at the 30-day and 6-month marks for each of the four flavors.  Here&#8217;s an example of the aftertaste and texture attributes:</p>

<h2>What We Learned</h2>



<p>We identified how the sensory profiles changed over time for each of the flavors. Here&#8217;s an example of the Orange Pineapple flavor:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sensory-profile-orange-flavor-1024x298.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1389" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sensory-profile-orange-flavor-1024x298.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sensory-profile-orange-flavor-300x87.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sensory-profile-orange-flavor-768x223.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sensory-profile-orange-flavor.png 1283w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>For common attributes, we determined that all products continue to deliver similarly for flavor, aroma intensity, aftertaste, and mouthfeel attributes.</p>

<p>Our client is launching a new grape-flavored chew.  Concept test results show this idea has superstar potential, and this product might bring in new buyers to the brand.<br></p>



<p>Benchtop samples were developed and tested with consumers to identify if there were opportunities to optimize the product. Then, a batch of pilot plant trial samples was produced.<br></p>



<p>Usually, texture differences are observed in pilot plant samples when compared to benchtop samples, therefore our objective is to compare the sensory profile of the ‘benchtop’ samples with the ‘pilot plant trial’ samples and understand if there are differences and if any optimizations are needed.</p>



<h2>Methodology</h2>



<p>We conducted Descriptive Analysis with our panel of sensory experts.</p>



<p>Data was collected using t-test. The t-test is a method that determines whether two populations are statistically different from each other.</p>



<p>Our lexicon training encompassed several attributes, such as aroma, texture in mouth, taste, flavor and aftertaste.</p>



<h2>What We Learned</h2>



<p>There are no differences detected between the Control – Benchtop and Test – Pilot samples.  Here&#8217;s a typical chart we use to illustrate these findings:</p>

<p>Did you know that one key area for sensory research is around claims?  Often, our clients utilize our research findings to be confident that they can make a particular claim in their marketing and packaging materials.   This was the thinking in this case study with our client who manufactures throat lozenges.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Our client, a confectionery manufacturer, wanted to develop a milder version of their current product for consumers seeking low intensity lozenges.  In addition, they wanted&nbsp;supportive data to make the “milder taste” claim on the product package. </p>



<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>



<p>We used Descriptive Analysis to evaluate 2 products &#8212; the original mint lozenge and the re-formulated mint lozenge.  Our 12 panelists from a trained descriptive panel evaluated each of the lozenges in our Harrison, NY sensory booths.  Training was held on key attribute intensities:  Overall Total Impact, Overall Flavor, and Cooling.  An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s means separation was used with 95% confidence level to understand attribute differences among samples. </p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>Our findings indicated that our client could confidently claim that their new mint lozenge was milder in taste than the current product.  Here&#8217;s an example of the data we provided:</p>

<p>Our client wanted to determine whether any sensory differences exist between the Control and Test samples of their Medicinal oil. The test sample utilized a masker to address an off-note in the Control.</p>



<h2>What We Did</h2>



<p>We utilized Descriptive Analysis and our panel of trained sensory experts, each with 7-10 years of experience to analyze the two products.</p>



<p>A lexicon was created based on the Control and the Test sample with masker. A lexicon is the language that is typically used to describe the product’s attributes.</p>



<span id="more-1042"></span>



<p>The Panel was then trained on the selected attributes.  Upon completion of the training, the panel evaluated the Control and Test samples in 2 replications.  Individual panel scores were collected online and a t-test analysis was performed at 95% confidence level.</p>



<h2>What We Learned</h2>



<p>The Masking agent did have an impact on the overall Flavor and on the Skunky notes of the Test samples.  The Test Sample with the masking agent was found to have less Overall Flavor Intensity, with less Skunky aroma and flavor; and slightly higher Astringency and bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p>In this case study, our client needed to qualify additional manufacturing lines in order to increase capacity on the production of chewable vitamins.  Providing additional capacity was essential to delivering on order commitments.<br></p>



<p>Most importantly, given the volumes of the business, we had to ensure that this change would not impact the sensory characteristics of the chewable vitamins and risk alienating our client’s current users.<br></p>



<span id="more-1017"></span>



<p>Leveraging descriptive analysis, we were able to incorporate the inherent variability in the current manufacturing process, so that we did not incorrectly fail a facility due to a difference from a single lot.</p>
